The goal of the design is to allow the operator to feel physically at a remote location, providing a stereo vision, surround sound, and movement tracking. The cameras and microphones will transmit the pictures and sounds to allow the operator see and hear as if they are at the remote location. The head tracking allows the operator to freely look around the remote location, while tracking movements from all three degrees of freedom. 

The use of this device will feel natural and immersive, allowing the user to achieve high accuracy in any task they hope to achieve at the remote location. It is also hoped that the device will be compact and have sufficient battery life so that it can be mounted to a variety of locations for a diverse range of applications. The versatility of the product will be a high priority. 

One of our distinguishing features over the existing products is our cost. We wish to be able to make our product affordable enough for the everyday consumer. This may mean trading off higher specification of equipment for equipment of lower cost when it makes sense to do so. 

We have produced a working demo of the telepresence system. This device is able to transmit stereo visual and audio information wirelessly to a HMD; it also has a compass overlay on the display and a 3-axis gimbal that moves in response to the HMD’s movements. We have also mounted this gimbal on a remote controlled car in order to perform testing. 

The code can not be run without hardware, they need the IMU and servo controllers.
